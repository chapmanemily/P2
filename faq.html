        <h3>Question 1: What even is Amazeriffic?</h3>
          <p class="q">An enigma, truly.</p>
         <h3>Question 2: Do you accept Discover card?</h3>
          <p class="q">Lol no.</p>
        <h3>Question 3: What does Freddie Mercury REALLY mean when he says "Jaws was never my scene and I don't like Star Wars" in Queen's hit song, Bicycle Race?</h3>
          <p class="q">Well, it's a fair question, I guess. But did you ever read 'MobyDick' ? I always remember the first words were "Call me Ishmael". But of course Herman Melville wasn't Ishmael. As with a novel, just because a song is written in the first person doesn't mean it's in any way autobiographical. According to experts, Freddie did like Jaws and Star Wars, he actually wasn't very keen on riding his bicycle (if he even had one) - he preferred being driven in a Rolls Royce! But he created a character in the song, and this character can say what he wants, and he can ride his bicycle where he likes.</p>
